## Human-Activities-Recognition
Human activity recognition and analysis deals with the recognition of certain human activities and manipulating precisely recorded data to check fitness. Activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, lying down. There are some physical activities that a person does in his daily life.

### Importing necessary libraries
### Loading data
### Data preprocessing
a Checking for duplicates
b Checking for missing values
c Checking for class imbalance
### Exploratory Data Analysis
a Analysing tBodyAccMag-mean feature
b Analysing Angle between X-axis and gravityMean feature
c Analysing Angle between Y-axis and gravityMean feature
d Visualizing data using t-SNE
### Headline based similarity on new articles
a Logistic regression model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation
b Linear SVM model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation
c Kernel SVM model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation
d Decision tree model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation
e Random forest model with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation

### Project Application in Real-Life:
1. Human activity recognition has wide applications in medical research and security systems.
2. Other applications could be in security in surveillance cameras. We can teach cameras to define a restricted area and mark the objects under focus.
