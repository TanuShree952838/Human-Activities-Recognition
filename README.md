# Human-Activities-Recognition
Human activity recognition and analysis deals with the recognition of certain human activities and manipulating precisely recorded data to check fitness. Activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, lying down. There are some physical activities that a person does in his daily life.

# Project Application in Real-Life:
1. Human activity recognition has wide applications in medical research and security systems.
2. Other applications could be in security in surveillance cameras. We can teach cameras to define a restricted area and mark the objects under focus.
